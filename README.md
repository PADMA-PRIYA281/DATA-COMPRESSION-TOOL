# DATA-COMPRESSION-TOOL

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: PADMA PRIYA R

INTERN ID: CT04DG91

DOMAIN: C PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

This program implements run-length encoding to compress strings by replacing repeated characters with a single character followed by its frequency. It uses loops and conditionals to process input efficiently. The task enhanced my understanding of string manipulation, compression logic, and how data redundancy can be minimized using simple algorithms.
